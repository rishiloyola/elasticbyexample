About this book
===============


This **book** is a small set of tutorials for the quick reference of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). The purpose is to make this book handy while working on elasticsearch. This book is useful to the beginners and intermediate level users.

The understanding curve of Elasticsearch is quite sniff. It has so much complex structured queries. That’s why I have tried to teach elasticsearch through examples and use cases. 
I am also planning to add small play ground to play with the elasticsearch queries. 

This book is still a work in progress, so sections may be incomplete, but I hope you will enjoy it as it grows. 

Thanks to [Mark McGranaghan](https://github.com/mmcgrana) for [Gobyexample](https://gobyexample.com), which inspired me to write this handbook.
